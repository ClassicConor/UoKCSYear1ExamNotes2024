# Expected Questions For Cloud

- A question on distributed algorithms will probably come up. This could include GFS, MapReduce, or the Congest Model
- A question on cloud stack (e.g. IaaS, PaaS), and types of cloud (e.g. public, private, hybrid, community)
- It will probably have three total questions, and we'll have to answer two (2023 paper had this format)
