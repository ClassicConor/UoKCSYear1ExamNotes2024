# University of Kent 2024 Computer Science Year 1 Exam Revision

Hope to regularly upload, including with past papers, notes, etc. I cannot guarantee that the answers for these are going to be 100% correct, but I think it's pretty good. If other people have additional notes they would like to add or edit stuff, that's all fine. Hopefully these can be used by the years next years going forwards.

This is the current status of these:

- FOC 1 (all filled in)
- FOC 2 (none filled in)
- Databases (all filled in)
- Cloud (partially filled in)
- HCI (all filled in)
