- Question 1 - What is a micro-interaction? Name any two of the four components of a
micro-interaction. Give one example of a micro-interaction in an interface.

A micro-interaction is a small, contained moment that is encapulated within a singe-use case.
Two of the four components are: trigger and rule.
An example of a micro-interaction is when a user clicks on the like button on Instagram, and there's a small animation that plays to indicate to the user that the button has been clicked and selected.

- Question 2: What are the problems with using a red circle to indicate “stop”, which changes
to a green circle when it is safe for the user to proceed with their action?

There are a number of problems with using a red circle to indicate stop.
One of the issues may be that in different cultures, the colours red and green may not have the same meanings in different countries, so although this colour pattern may work within the west, people in other countries may not be able to use it.

Another example may be whether an individual is suffering with colour blindness or not. If an individual has this, they may not be able to differentiate the different colours on the screen.

For both of these examples, adding icons and additional textual information may be useful.

- What is the difference between menu depth and menu
breadth? Which is better to use to present menu
choices to users, and why?

- With regard to human memory, what is a retrieval cue? Give two examples of retrieval cues used in in- terface design.

A retrieval queue is a way to help a user recall information stored in memory, potentially allowing the user to interact with different programs without having to learn an entirely new way of interacting and operating with the machine.

For example, the user will know that having back and forward arrows will allow the user to go backwards and forwards across pages, no matter what program is being used. Another example is having website icons in the tabs of a web browser. Having the YouTube logo within each web tab reminds the user that that specific tab shows YouTube.

- We distinguish between two types of user errors: slips and mistakes. Slips are unconscious errors – right intention, but wrong action. In no more than one sentence, identify which type of user is more prone to “slips”, and why?

More experienced users may be more prone to slips instead of mistakes because they may be more use to a user interface, and will not have as many issues navigating a UI if they were going at their own pace. Very often, slips occur when the user attempts to rush getting to a particular part of the program, and by doing this they will make mistakes because they are not focused on their individual actions.

| H1: Visibility of system status                             | The system should always keep users informed about what is going on,<br>through appropriate feedback within reasonable time<br>\- Provide feedback on user input<br>\- Use status indicators, icons                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| H2: Match between system and the real world                 | The system should speak the user's language, with words, phrases and<br>concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms<br>\- Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and<br>logical order                                             |
| H3: User control and freedom                                | Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue<br>\- Undo and redo buttons<br>\- Cancel button                                                          |
| H4: Consistency and standards                               | Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing<br>\- Follow platform conventions                                                                                                                                                 |
| H5: Error prevention                                        | Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place<br>\- Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action                     |
| H6: Recognition rather than recall                          | Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible<br>\- The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another<br>\- Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate |
| H7: Flexibility and efficiency of use                       | Accelerators—unseen by the novice user—may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users<br>\- Allow users to tailor frequent actions                                                                 |
| H8: Aesthetic and minimalist design                         | Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed<br>\- Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility                                                            |
| H9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors | Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution                                                                                                                                                |
| H10: Help and documentation                                 | Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation<br>\- Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large          |
