# HCI Exam 2021 - Answers to the questions

## Question 1

Heuristic Evaluation (HE) is a useful method to evaluate a computer interface. It has a standard report format and 10 Heuristics rules. Suppose you want to develop a mobile app for online Burger ordering and delivery as a UI/UX designer.

### (a)

For each of the following usability problem, use the HE Report format to list which Heuristic rule it goes against and justify the reason, give a Severity rating within a scale of 0-4 and justify the reason, and suggest a Fix.

> (i) Problem 1: No progress indicator for payment processing page, which takes more than 10 sec to respond.

[fill in answer]

> (ii) Problem 2: Users are not able to input a delivery address.

[fill in answer]

> (b) As a software development team manager, you need to fix the above 2 usability problems. Which problem(s) do you have to fix before releasing the app? Justify your answer using one sentence

[fill in answer]

### c

There are a wide range of controls and widgets to choose for the user interface design. For each of the following page design, list which type of digital controls and widgets should be used.

> (i) Page 1: Users can choose one type of burger from Hamburger, Chicken burger, Veggie burger.

[fill in answer]

> (ii) Page 2: Users can choose one or multiple toppings from Tomato, Lettuce, Pickles, Cheese.

[fill in answer]

## Question 2

KLM-GOMS stands for Keystroke-level model for Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules. It is composed of methods that are used to achieve specific goals. In KLM-GOMS, methods are composed of operators at the lowest level. Operators might include K(key/button) =0.2 sec, P(point) = 1.1 sec, H(home) = 0.4 sec, M(mentally prepare) = 1.35 sec, R(response).

### (a) For the currency converter listed in Figure 1 below, estimate the time to for Hal to use the interface for converting 3 pounds into Euros by showing the workout apply the following steps where necessary. Assume Hal’s typing is perfect; error detection and notification are not needed. The default currency is pounds to Euro. After a number is input in the text box corresponding to pounds, the conversation is immediately displayed in the text box next to the Euro. No enter key is required to fulfill the conversation

> (i) Step 1: Operators (HPKHK) are involved to achieve the task. Justify the choice of each operator using one sentence.

[fill in answer]

> (ii) Step 2: Apply Rule 0, add Ms in front of all Ks and Ps that point to commands.

[fill in answer]

> (iii) Step 3: Apply Rule 1, change PMK to PK to remove fully anticipated Ms.

[fill in answer]

> (iv) Step 4: Apply Rule 2, to eliminate Ms in the middle of strings that are cognitive units.

[fill in answer]

> (v) Step 5: Apply Rule 3, deletion of Ms before consecutive terminators.

[fill in answer]

> (vi) Step 6: Apply Rule 4, deletion of Ms that are terminators of commands.

[fill in answer]

> (vii) Step 7: Apply Rule 5, deletion of overlapped Ms.

[fill in answer]

> (viii) Step 8: Calculate the time.

[fill in answer]

### (b) Colour vision and perception play an important role in user interface design. Answer the following questions with one sentence

> (i) Choice of colour combination in interface design: different wavelengths of light focused on different distances behind eye’s lens, therefore colour combinations need extra care in user interface design. Which two colour’s combination would cause eye to fatigue the most; justify your answer (red and yellow, green and red, green and orange, red and blue)?

[fill in answer]

> (ii) State the consequence of an interface design with only two colours (red and green) to indicate its states.

[fill in answer]

> (iii) You want to create a web interface for an organic food company for online order. In order to represent the company’s ethos of linked to nature, peace, well-being, environment- friendly and freshness, which of the three colour scheme (red, blue, white, green) you should choose for the theme of the web design.

[fill in answer]

>(iv) In order to design a lo-fi interface, what is the best choice of
colour for the interface.

[fill in answer]

## Question 3

Human Centred Design (HCD) Process consists of five stages: Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test.

### (a) For each of the following activity, match the activity to the most appropriate HCD stage as above

> (i) Activity 1: A paper model of the actual design is developed.

[fill in answer]

> (ii) Activity 2: Users are asked to evaluate the design and give comments.

[fill in answer]

> (iii) Activity 3: Several designs approaches are discussed by development team.

[fill in answer]

> (iv) Activity 4: Information collected from users is tabled in a structured form.

[fill in answer]

> (v) Activity 5: Users are interviewed to obtain their requirements.

### (b) HCD utilises many heuristics and design approaches. For each of the following scenario, give the appropriate name of the heuristic or activity. Briefly (in no more than one sentence each), explain your reasoning for giving the heuristic/activity names

> (i) Scenario 1: In a shop, there are two entry doors; one big and another small.

[fill in answer]

> (ii) Scenario 2: A company manager wants good quality software. The manager is willing to spend a lot of money but wants fast delivery of the completed software.

[fill in answer]

> (iii) Scenario 3: In a web interface, a software developer has designed very large buttons to help the elderly click the buttons easily.

[fill in answer]

> (iv) Scenario 4: A person tries to remember a telephone number (01634888867) by partitioning it into three parts: 01634 888 867.

[fill in answer]

> (v) Scenario 5: Mother’s maiden name is used to retrieve passwords.

## Question 4

For this question, you will need to design a simple interface for a microwave without any digital display. The microwave has only FIVE functions:

- START/STOP
- Microwave power mode (LOW/MED/HIGH)
- Microwave heating time for up to 30 minutes
- Open door
- Overheat warning

> (a) Sketch an interface design (with appropriate annotations on its usage) that includes approximately designed menu interface for the five functions above.
